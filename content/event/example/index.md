title: Research Bite Presentation (3rd Jul 2025)

event: Presentation on Tidymass Project

location: LKC Medicine, EMB

summary: A sharing on Tidymass Project - an advanced untargeted LC-MS metabolomics data analysis workflow.
abstract: Yijiang presented TidyMass2, an enhanced computational framework for untargeted LC-MS metabolomics that improves metabolite annotation and biological interpretation. TidyMass2 introduces a unified chemical ID conversion system, an interactive web interface (TidyMassShiny), and a novel database, MetOriginDB, for tracing metabolite origins across human, microbial, and environmental sources. It also features a new module-based analysis strategy that identifies biologically relevant patterns without relying solely on MS2 data. Applied to a pregnancy urine dataset, TidyMass2 uncovered dynamic metabolic changes and environmental exposures, demonstrating its potential to expand insights into complex biological systems..
